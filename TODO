[X] AudioQueue playback for core formats
[X] get audio playback off the main thread!
[X] expose gain input
[ ] pre-cache file input, do not wait for playback to begin
[ ] auto-reset playback when it hits the end of the sample
[ ] add time input
[ ] add some sort of time output?
[ ] migrate to ARC

LATER
[ ] may need some locking around queue access? (use GCD)

[ ] audio file subpatch to output struct of time, ID3?
[/] consider changing patch to kQCPlugInExecutionModeProcessor to output current time
    doesn't make sense
