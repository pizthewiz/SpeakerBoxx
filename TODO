NOW
[X] AudioQueue playback for core formats
[X] get audio playback off the main thread!
[X] expose gain input
[ ] auto-reset playback when it hits the end of the sample
[ ] pre-cache file input, do not wait for playback to begin

LATER
[ ] may need some locking around queue access? (use GCD)
[ ] tone generator subpatch - sawtooth, triangle, pulse (square), noise + sine

[ ] audio file subpatch to output struct of time, ID3?
[ ] add time input and output?
[/] consider changing patch to kQCPlugInExecutionModeProcessor to output current time
    doesn't make sense
